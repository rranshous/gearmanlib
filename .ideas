first (accomplished) goal is to be able to supply a module name
and a callable to import and it would create a worker for that function

right now I'm using pickle clients but that may change

if you just supply a tuple than i send it's contents as seperate
args to the worker function

future goal is to share all callables by name, be able to supply a prefix for
the worker names, and a number of workers to fire up per helper

first (accomplished) goal is to be able to supply a module name
and a callable to import and it would create a worker for that function

right now I'm using pickle clients but that may change

if you just supply a tuple than i send it's contents as seperate
args to the worker function

future goal is to share all callables by name, be able to supply a prefix for
the worker names, and a number of workers to fire up per helper

need to come up w/ a default key for worker names. the callable
name seems most obvious, but might not be unique enough. maybe the name of the working dir + function name working under the assumption that the clone is named the same thing on each machine? we'll go w/ that for now
